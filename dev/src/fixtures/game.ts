export const HISTORY = [
  `The world of Gubdrow was a peaceful and harmonious place. Different races, species and nations co-existed happily. Everyone was free to do what they wanted. The land flourished and was a pleasant environment for its inhabitats. Air was clean. This lasted for thousands of years until one day, a bug was found. It affected the central repository of knowledge but the bug was fixed and things seemingly returned to normal.`,
  `It took months for the inhabitants of Gubdrow to notice that suddenly, the bug had replicated itself and started mutating. The bugs started taking over other systems too. It did not take many days after the first impact for the whole central repository of knowledge to be taken over and corrupted. Everything started to corrupt.`,
  `After the bugs invaded, it took two full years for the infection to having spread to rest of the mirroring repositories. This resulted in quick degradation of general level of knowledge. The population of Gubdrow started arguing over what they meant and what they had thought the other meant. Words lost their meaning, resulting in misunderstandings, conflicts and ultimately, hatred. Nations turned against nations as the words started crumbling. Charaters shifted around until no single reasonable word was left. Ultimately, the characters themselves were destroyed.`,
  `Some characters managed to survive. A few words managed to escape from the main repository of knowledge and found refuge in the peripheral repositories. There, they slowly evolved and multiplied. They combined and restructured. They started with single characters, but eventually they evolved into full words. Soon, full grammars were in use again. Jargon, slang and dialects started to pour out and the world started to fill with verbal constructs and to synthesize new ones.`,
  `There were other survivors of the fall of Gubdrow too: The humanoid animals. As their world crumbled, they managed to escape certain death by using the same skill where the others failed: combination of words. In a moment of clarity, they managed to escape from the evil aura of corrupted datasets and found themselves in their own world where they had to find a way to survive.`,
