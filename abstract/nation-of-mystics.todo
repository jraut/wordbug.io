The Nation of Mystics is a peacful and secretive nation They do not like it when others interfere in their affairs. If they are not respected, they can be very dangerous.

The Nation of Mystics is a place of learning and knowledge. It is a land where people who seek guidance and knowledge come to find it. They learn how to control their own powers and how to use them correctly. They learn how to control the reality and create something out of nothing, or destroy something that already exists.

It is said that this nation was created by a group of mystics who traveled from one country to another, teaching their skills to the people they met on their way. In time, they decided to settle down in an empty place. The people who joined them were taught their skills and were given the chance to practice them. In time, they became stronger and more powerful, and they created a nation for themselves.

The mystics that created this nation are now gone. They left behind a group of people who keep the knowledge alive, passing it from one generation to another. Their descendants are now living in all of the other nations on the continent, but they are not neccessarily mystics themselves anymore. They have no powers of the magnitude the great mystics once had, but they still have the knowledge about the other worlds and how to use it properly. They know how to use their powers for good, but they may also use them for evil if they so desire.

The nation itself is made out of old buildings from other countries, all built together in a strange mixture that is not seen anywhere else in the world. The buildings are made out of different materials, some made out of stone, others made out of wood or metal. The buildings have been added onto over the years, so that now they have become a strange combination of different styles and shapes. The architecture has become very unique because of this development over time.

The people of this country are known for their knowledge of all things mystical. They can see things that others cannot see, hear things that others cannot hear and feel things that others cannot feel. They can also manipulate things that others cannot manipulate. Many years ago, they were able to manipulate the reality itself, but over the time the Pact of Disownal was formed to prevent the collapse of the world itself due to misuse.
