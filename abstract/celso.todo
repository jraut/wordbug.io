Celso is a squirrel. He comes from the Mystic Nation which is known for their knowledge of the worlds of beyond. He lost his parents when he was young. His brother was responsible for his upbringing and he brought him to the nation of his ancestors. They had to part ways when his brother was needed to defend the nation. He always felt guilty for not being able to help his brother in time, but he knew he was doing what was best for him. Celso was lucky that there were many wise scholars there who took him in.

After having mastered his studies, Celso decided to bring peace to his nation. He used his psychic powers to help all the families who were suffering from the loss of proper words for their loved ones. He started using the forgotten old knowledge to reduce the confusion. The nation was shocked at first, but once they found out that they could use this new method to bring back understanding between each other. This new method worked and restored happiness to all of them.

Celso continued helping the nation for a while. He helped the new generations to grow and flourish. The new generations started to live without any memories of the great corruption and they did not feel the need to meditate and pray. They were happy and satisfied with their life. Celso did not blame them. It was probably for the best.

The story of Celso

Celso has been on a journey to find the Grand Deities since he was a child. In this journey, he is always accompanied by his companions. In the first volume, he saves a penguin from an old women's slaughtering machine and adopts him as his new friend. In the second volume, he saves a female orangutan from a hunter and they fall in love with each other. In the third volume, Celso saved a dolphin from a shark.

Birds - Celso's companion

In every volume, birds would come and make their nest in the same tree where Celso resides. They also feed from his tree fruits. The following are birds of different varieties: Eagles, peacocks, crows, toucans, swans, woodpeckers and sparrows. In all volumes, they come and stay around Celso's tree for a short period of time and go back to their original habitat. Sometimes they would be chased away by squirrels and other animals and birds that dwell in Gubdrow. Celso and his friends help them fight off the hunters and give them sanctuary whenever they can. They try to protect their freedom as birds. This is evident when Celso helped free the penguin from the old woman's slaughtering machine.
