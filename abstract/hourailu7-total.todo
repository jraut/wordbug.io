OPENAI:

I mean, it's about the only thing that's good about this game (IMO).

About the game itself, it's kinda like playing a game like Zero Wing, but with no funny plot, just a bunch of random words.

I think that the plot is just a bunch of random words that are put together. The plot is just plain dumb, but if you want to just play the game to see the plot, I suggest you don't do it. You have no idea what will happen. You have to go to the plot part of the game to understand the plot.

This game makes me wonder why people call this game a masterpiece...

It's just a bunch of random lines. The plot pretty much makes me think that the plot of the game is just nothing nothing.

I think that the plot of this game is just one of the worst plot I've ever seen. I don't know why people call this game a masterpiece. It's just a bunch of random words that are put together. There are plot holes all around this game.

I mean, why are there plot holes in the plot of the game? And why are there plot holes in this game?

I can't even explain why this game is popular.

It's just...

A story about a wolf pilot

Once upon a time there was a wolf who had an airplane. One day, while he was taking off, the engine stopped. The wolf did not know what to do, so he went to ask the rabbit for help.

�Rabbit, I have a problem. My plane has stopped while I was taking off.�

�Oh, it�s easy. You just have to turn the key to start it again.�

So the wolf turned the key to start the plane, but it did not work. But the rabbit did not know anything about airplanes, so he just said to the wolf:

�Try it again, maybe you did it wrong.�

So the wolf turned the key again, but it did not work. Then the rabbit said:

�Try it again, maybe the gasoline is not enough.�

So the wolf tried again, but the plane did not start. Then the rabbit said:

�I think you should try to start it with your hand.�

So the wolf tried, but the plane did not start. The rabbit said:

�Maybe you should use your mouth.�

So the wolf started the plane with his mouth, but the plane did not start. Then the rabbit said:

�I think you should use your paws.�

So the wolf used his paws to start the plane.

The plane worked.

The wolf was very happy, and he flew back to his home.

A story about a squirrel pilot

One time, I was walking along the street, when I saw a guy walking along the road. He seemed to be just walking, not paying attention to anything. I was walking along the street too. I didn't pay attention to anything either, because I was busy thinking about what I wanted to say to my friend when I saw him later.

Anyway, I was walking along the street, not paying attention to anything, when I saw this guy walking along the road. He was walking fast. Actually, I didn't see him at first. I saw his reflection in the window. It was an expensive car window, and it was reflecting the street. I saw the guy's reflection, and I thought to myself, "I bet that guy has no idea how rich he is."

So, I looked at the reflection in the window, and I saw that guy walking along the road. He was walking fast, and he was walking along the road. I mean, he didn't walk in the street. He walked on one side of the road. He wasn't walking along the road. He was walking on one side of the road. So, I looked at the reflection in the window, and I noticed that the guy was walking along the road.

And I saw his reflection in the window. He was walking along the road, and I saw his reflection in the window. It was an expensive car window, and it was reflecting the street. I saw the guy's reflection, and I said to myself, "Boy, that guy has no idea how rich he is."

So, I noticed that he was walking along the road, and I said to myself, "Boy, that guy has no idea how rich he is." I said that to myself, and I noticed that he was walking along the road, and I saw his reflection in the window. It was an expensive car.

A story about a lizard pilot

The video link below is to a short video about a lizard pilot.

(This link was valid as of July 2017; we can't guarantee it will work forever.)

Link to the YouTube video:

https://youtu.be/F4_GaDQh-6s

The story is written by a retired US Air Force officer, and the video is an animated version of the story.

"Here is a story that I wrote and put to video about a lizard who is a pilot. There are other videos on YouTube, but this is by far the best. I recommend that you share it with children and adults who want to enjoy a fun, short story. Also, the lizard is quite cute and the animation is excellent. Enjoy!"

- The author of the story, Don

THE LIZARD PILOT

A young girl went to the local pet store and asked for a lizard. The storekeeper showed her a beautiful green lizard and explained that the lizard could live for several years and would make a wonderful pet. The girl liked the lizard and decided to buy it.

As she was paying for it, the storekeeper said, "I'll tell you what. Since you are a first-time lizard buyer, I'll give you a lesson book on how to take care of a lizard." He pointed to a book entitled, "How to Take Care of a Lizard."

"Oh, thank you," the girl said.

She took her lizard home, read the book, and carefully followed its instructions.

The next day, she returned to the store. "You told me that lizards make good pets," she said. "But mine died."

"Don't worry," said the storekeeper, "lizards are like people. Some are born to be pets".
