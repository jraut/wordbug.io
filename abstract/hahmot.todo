History of Celso
-----Response
He lost his parents when he was young. His brother brought him to the nation of his ancestors. Celso was lucky that there were many wise scholars there who took him in. His brother was responsible for his upbringing. He could not be with his brother in the forest since he was needed to defend the nation. He always felt guilty for not being able to help his brother in time, but he knew he was doing what was best for him. The nation prospered under his brother's reign. His brother got married and had children, but he never returned from his last mission.

This whole situation broke his brother's family. They never got over this tragedy. Celso decided to bring peace to his nation. He used his psychic powers to help all the families who were suffering from the loss of their loved ones. He started using the forgotten old knowledge to raise the dead. The nation was shocked at first, but once they found out that they could use this new method to bring their lost ones back, they were all for it. This new method worked and restored happiness to all of them. Celso continued helping the families for a while. He helped the new generations to grow and flourish. The new generations started to live without any memories of their ancestors and they did not feel the need to meditate and pray. They were happy and satisfied with their life. Celso did not blame them. It was probably for the best.

-----Response
Rugo's strength and agility make him an effective warrior. His sharp claws and fangs make him deadly in combat. He is able to fight against numerous enemies at once, and he is able to attack from afar with projectiles. He is a strong and agile warrior, and he will be our key to victory.

For all his agility and energy, Rugo's biggest weakness is his health. He's not that strong to take a lot of damage, and he has to rely on his agility and speed to dodge enemy attacks.

Once we're funded we plan to make more characters for the game.

When Rugo was born, she had a slightly unusual head shape, so her parents did not believe she was of pure blood. Rugo proved them wrong. She learned to hunt at a very young age. She also learned how to control the spirit of the wolf. As Rugo grew up, she became more and more skilled in combat.

One day, when Rugo was hunting in the forest, she met an old man who was camping in the woods. The old man's name was "Papa" Paul. He was blind, but he had powerful hearing. He was very kind, and he taught Rugo to be kind too.

Rugo was happy with her life, but everything changed when she learned about the war. Her parents were called to war to protect the kingdom. Rugo was in despair, but she knew that she had to do something to protect her homeland.

Celso is one of the survivors. This little cute squirrel was born in the days of the great disaster. Her mother, Lilith, gave birth to her in the very early hours of the disaster. Their home was in the small town in the mountains. There were no cities in the area at that time. It was a very beautiful place with beautiful plants and wildlife. The mountains, especially, attracted many tourists each year, who liked to go hiking and camping. This gave the mountain dwellers quite a lot of income. As she grew, Celso realized that her parents were not like others around them. She could do things that others couldn't. She has the power to read minds, see the future and predict the weather, things like that. And she was only eight years old when she found out! But she was always trying to hide it, she did not want to seem different, she was just trying to fit in. She had no friends. Everyone around her was so boring, all they did was farm and she did not want to do that. She did not want to stay in one place for too long. She wanted to travel and see the world. She wanted to be rich, like the queen of the land, who lived in the city.

She could not wait to grow up and then get the hell out of there! She could see the future, she was sure that one day she would be queen of the land. The king was old and her mother Lilith kept telling her that she could never get to the throne if she married someone
