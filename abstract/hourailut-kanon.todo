## The world of Gubdrow

## History of Gubdrow

The world of Gubdrow was a peaceful and harmonious place. Different races, species and nations co-existed happily. Everyone was free to do what they wanted. The land flourished and was a pleasant environment for its inhabitats. Air was clean. This lasted for thousands of years until one day, a bug was found. It affected the central repository of knowledge but the bug was fixed and things seemingly returned to normal.

It took months for the inhabitants of Gubdrow to notice that suddenly, the bug had replicated itself and started mutating. The bugs started taking over other systems too. It did not take many days after the first impact for the whole central repository of knowledge to be taken over and corrupted. Everything started to corrupt.

The fall and the corruption of Gubdrow

After the bugs invaded, it took two full years for the infection to having spread to rest of the mirroring repositories. This resulted in quick degradation of general level of knowledge. The population of Gubdrow started arguing over what they meant and what they had thought the other meant. Words lost their meaning, resulting in misunderstandings, conflicts and ultimately, hatred. Nations turned against nations as the words started crumbling. Charaters shifted around until no single reasonable word was left. Ultimately, the characters themselves were destroyed.

## The survival

The survival

Some characters managed to survive. A few words managed to escape from the main repository of knowledge and found refuge in the peripheral repositories. There, they slowly evolved and multiplied. They combined and restructured. They started with single characters, but eventually they evolved into full words. Soon, full grammars were in use again. Jargon, slang and dialects started to pour out and the world started to fill with verbal constructs and to synthesize new ones.

There were other survivors of the fall of Gubdrow too: The humanoid animals. As their world crumbled, they managed to escape certain death by using the same skill where the others failed: combination of words. In a moment of clarity, they managed to escape from the evil aura of corrupted datasets and found themselves in their own world where they had to find a way to survive.

## Rugo, Celso and Mira - The emergent heroes of Gubdrow

---

Rugo, Celso and Mira were three survivors of the destruction of Gubdrow. They were good friends and as such promised to meet up again after the fall of Gubdrow. It was hard to travel, as everything was destroyed and nearly everything died.

Rugo's ancestors lived in the northern part of Gubdrow and after the fall he decided to go there to find out if other members of his kind survived and so he travelled to the North. It was a grim and depressing journey as he saw other survivors kill each other at their first opportunity and the only other alternative was to travel with the creatures of the underworld. But Rugo's ancestors had lived in this part of Gubdrow so he hoped he'd find some remnant of his species if he saw the place closely.

This is where his journey started. Rugo found very few characters in the North. A lot of characters were missing. He found broken shards of treasure, large piles of garbage, lifeless treasure chests and many more things that were commonplace in the good old days. He also found pieces of information about the world that was before the devastation of Gubdrow. Rugo had come across a mysterious bag that had some pieces of paper with strange odd markings. Rugo's species could not read the pieces of paper with the odd symbols however seeing the shards of treasure, broken machines and remains of ancient books, he managed to make out the meaning.

Rugo set out on a journey looking for others with these pieces of paper in their possession.

The village of Tibi

After Rugo's quest in the north, he journeyed to an ancient village which was still in tact. Here he met Tibi, this little creature was clever, funny and Rugo quickly befriended him. Tibi was an ancient dragon whom had lived in the village long before the destruction of Gubdrow.

Tibi was kind to Rugo but did not give him any information about Gubdrow. Rugo did not need anyone to tell him how terrible it was. He was actually thankful to Tibi for letting him come to his village.

After meeting Tibi, Rugo travelled to many different places to find his friends.

Rugo's adventure

Through his journey, Rugo found many different characters. Some met him with hostility, some were friendly, some took advantage of him and some even betrayed him. Rugo had to watch out for his life. He once came across some peaceful people living in the old capital of the North. They gave him some of their food, water and information.

Tibi had told Rugo of an old friend of his. He was living at the very top of their capital city. A mysterious character who lived with his family in a shack deep in the secret part of the city. Rugo was wary at first but he needed some secret information that he wanted to find. He was also looking for his friend Celso who had told him that he was coming to the very top of the city on his travel to find Rugo.

Rugo made a deal with a famous ship captain who would take Rugo to the very top of the capital. It was a dangerous journey but fortunately Rugo had a powerful pet with him, a big armor beetle who loves to eat donuts.

Rugo made a deal with a trader that if he could find a pearl from a specific creature, he would bring him to the top of the capital. Rugo's armor beetle helped him find the pearl. Together they defeated the creature and Rugo got the pearl. Rugo paid the trader and left for the capital. With this, Rugo travelled from the frozen North to a warm and peaceful farm in a ship full of rodents and a red bird who was a sailor's pet.

Once at the top, Rugo met his friend Celso and Celso told him that he was going to a town in the South West looking for a map piece. Rugo parted ways with his friend and decided to make his way to the West.

The journey to the West

Rugo's armor beetle helped him find the way to the West. The beetle was very useful in finding his way in the forest. Rugo got to know his beetle much better from their time in the forest. Together they fought and worked and did everything that came their way.

Rugo did not meet any other strong allies. He met a young and brave hedgehog who thought he was very smart and wanted to help Rugo. He did not realise just how dangerous their journey was and Rugo did not reveal much so he did not upset the hedgehog by telling him this was a
