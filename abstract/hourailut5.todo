Rugo, Celso and Mira - The emergent heroes of Gubdrow

---

Rugo, Celso and Mira were three survivors of the destruction of Gubdrow. They were good friends and as such promised to meet up again after the fall of Gubdrow. It was hard to travel, as everything was destroyed and nearly everything died.

Rugo's ancestors lived in the northern part of Gubdrow and after the fall he decided to go there to find out if other members of his kind survived and so he travelled to the North. It was a grim and depressing journey as he saw other survivors kill each other at their first opportunity and the only other alternative was to travel with the creatures of the underworld. But Rugo's ancestors had lived in this part of Gubdrow so he hoped he'd find some remnant of his species if he saw the place closely.

This is where his journey started. Rugo found very few characters in the North. A lot of characters were missing. He found broken shards of treasure, large piles of garbage, lifeless treasure chests and many more things that were commonplace in the good old days. He also found pieces of information about the world that was before the devastation of Gubdrow. Rugo had come across a mysterious bag that had some pieces of paper with strange odd markings. Rugo's species could not read the pieces of paper with the odd symbols however seeing the shards of treasure, broken machines and remains of ancient books, he managed to make out the meaning.

Rugo set out on a journey looking for others with these pieces of paper in their possession.

The village of Tibi

After Rugo's quest in the north, he journeyed to an ancient village which was still in tact. Here he met Tibi, this little creature was clever, funny and Rugo quickly befriended him. Tibi was an ancient dragon whom had lived in the village long before the destruction of Gubdrow.

Tibi was kind to Rugo but did not give him any information about Gubdrow. Rugo did not need anyone to tell him how terrible it was. He was actually thankful to Tibi for letting him come to his village.

After meeting Tibi, Rugo travelled to many different places to find his friends.

Rugo's adventure

Through his journey, Rugo found many different characters. Some met him with hostility, some were friendly, some took advantage of him and some even betrayed him. Rugo had to watch out for his life. He once came across some peaceful people living in the old capital of the North. They gave him some of their food, water and information.

Tibi had told Rugo of an old friend of his. He was living at the very top of their capital city. A mysterious character who lived with his family in a shack deep in the secret part of the city. Rugo was wary at first but he needed some secret information that he wanted to find. He was also looking for his friend Celso who had told him that he was coming to the very top of the city on his travel to find Rugo.

Rugo made a deal with a famous ship captain who would take Rugo to the very top of the capital. It was a dangerous journey but fortunately Rugo had a powerful pet with him, a big armor beetle who loves to eat donuts.

Rugo made a deal with a trader that if he could find a pearl from a specific creature, he would bring him to the top of the capital. Rugo's armor beetle helped him find the pearl. Together they defeated the creature and Rugo got the pearl. Rugo paid the trader and left for the capital. With this, Rugo travelled from the frozen North to a warm and peaceful farm in a ship full of rodents and a red bird who was a sailor's pet.

Once at the top, Rugo met his friend Celso and Celso told him that he was going to a town in the South West looking for a map piece. Rugo parted ways with his friend and decided to make his way to the West.

The journey to the West

Rugo's armor beetle helped him find the way to the West. The beetle was very useful in finding his way in the forest. Rugo got to know his beetle much better from their time in the forest. Together they fought and worked and did everything that came their way.

Rugo did not meet any other strong allies. He met a young and brave hedgehog who thought he was very smart and wanted to help Rugo. He did not realise just how dangerous their journey was and Rugo did not reveal much so he did not upset the hedgehog by telling him this was a
