The people of the Nation of Traders are descendants of a group of immigrants, who traveled from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere. They were seeking for a new home, because their own homeland was destroyed by a great flood. The immigrants followed the road of the sun, until they reached the northernmost continent. There they found what they were looking for: fertile soil, mountains full of precious stones and metals, and rivers flowing through the land. They settled down in the land that was named after them: Nation of Traders.

The Nation of Traders is ruled by a council of twelve elders. They are elected by the people every six years. The elders are responsible for managing the affairs of the nation and its foreign policy. The elders are also in charge of appointing judges to handle all legal matters in the country. Judges are appointed for life, unless they commit a crime or fail to fulfill their duties.

The Nation of Traders is divided into three provinces: North, South and East. Each province is governed by a governor, who is appointed by the council of elders. The governors are responsible for managing provincial affairs and foreign policy within their province. Governors are elected for life, unless they commit a crime or fail to fulfill their duties.

The people of the Nation of Traders live in cities that are connected by roads that lead to other cities in the nation and to foreign countries. They build their houses on hillsides or on top of mountains, so that they can defend themselves against attacks from enemies. The people are very skilled in building walls and fortresses around their cities to protect themselves from enemies.

The citizens are skilled craftsmen and artisans. They make beautiful jewelry out of gold and silver, they craft intricate furniture out of wood, they weave beautiful clothes out of silk and cotton, they engrave stones to be used as seals or amulets, they build ships out of wood to be used by merchants and traders to transport goods across seas and oceans, and they build weapons out of metal to be used by soldiers when needed.
